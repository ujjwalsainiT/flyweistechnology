                <h3>Adapting to a Remote Workforce</h3>

                <p className="text-justify">
                  The survey reveals a massive shift toward remote and homebased
                  work environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While a
                  majority of 63% of organizations had up to a quarter of
                  employees working in remote/at home environments before the
                  crisis, a whopping three quarters of the same organizations
                  report that over 75% of their workforce is now working from
                  home. A majority of organizations say they successfully
                  expanded capacity to fully support the expanded workforce in
                  seven days or less. While 79% of organizations believe they
                  had adequate WFH security preparations, two-thirds of
                  organizations in this survey are concerned with the security
                  risks by users working from home. The top security controls in
                  place to protect remote work/work from home are anti-virus/
                  anti-malware solutions, firewalls , virtual private networks
                  and multi-factor authentication (User awareness ranks highest
                  on the list of key security challenges facing organizations
                  that are increasing their remote workforces. This is followed
                  by accessing through home or unsecure public networks and the
                  use of personal devices Malware, phishing, unauthorized
                  user/device access, and unpatched systems were identified as
                  top attack vectors due to employees working from home. Among
                  applications contributing to productivity and collaboration,
                  organizations have the most security concerns with file
                  sharing, web applications,video conferencing and messaging A
                  majority of confirm they enforce the same level of security
                  controls for all roles that access remotelyNearly
                  three-quarters of organizations allowed access from personal,
                  unmanaged devices to support work from home, while at least
                  27% see this scenario as a significant security risk. A
                  majority of 54% confirm that the COVID pandemic accelerated
                  migration of workflows to cloudbased apps. Organizations are
                  most concerned with protection of sensitive data, especially
                  when accessed by unmanaged endpoints followed by added
                  exposure to malware .Two-thirds of organizations see remote
                  work environments having an impact on their compliance
                  postureThirty-eight percent of organizations expressed they
                  see higher productivity and other benefits from remote work.
                  Only 16% see lower productivity. A majority of 84% of
                  organizations consider it likely (44% very likely) that they
                  will continue increased work from home capabilities in the
                  future, taking advantage of increased productivity and other
                  business benefits. A majority of organizations expect budgets
                  for remote workforce security to increase over the next 12
                  months). For a quarter of respondents, these security budgets
                  will stay flat and only see budgets shrinking. The study,
                  titled Future of Secure Remote Work, aims to better understand
                  the challenges that organizations faced in transitioning to
                  remote work, while uncovering the state of their cybersecurity
                  readiness, as well as the shifts in their priorities,
                  policies, and investments as they prepare for a hybrid work
                  environment that is likely here to stay.

                <h3>Emerging 5G Application</h3>

                <p className="text-justify">
                  5G is not just an evolutionary upgrade of the previous
                  generation of cellular, but it is a revolutionary technology
                  envisioned that will eliminate the bounds of access,
                  bandwidth, performance, and latency limitations on
                  connectivity worldwide. 5G has the potential to enable
                  fundamentally new applications, industries, and business
                  models and dramatically improve quality of life around the
                  world via unprecedented use cases that require high data-rate
                  instantaneous communications, low latency, and massive
                  connectivity for new applications for mobile, eHealth,
                  autonomous vehicles, smart cities, smart homes, and the IoT.
                  5G is about a new communication system that includes a mostly
                  framework and an entirely new core network that aims to
                  improve wireless connections worldwide. It also includes the
                  concept of multiple access for connectivity technologies like
                  satellites, wi-fi fixed-line and cellular/ With IoT-enabled
                  devices in mind, 5G connects more devices at higher speeds and
                  makes things like lag nearly non-existent. As a result, 5G
                  creates an excellent user experience irrespective of what
                  application, device or service you touch. technologies are
                  characterized as a low-cost, low-power consumption solution.
                  They thrive on deep and broad coverage indoors and outdoors.
                  They deliver secure connectivity and authentication, are easy
                  to deploy to any network topology and are designed for full
                  scope scalability and capacity upgrades.Businesses, city
                  developers and other industrial organizations can connect more
                  devices with better capability for much less — all with the
                  power of 5G adaptability at their fingertips. As proposed by
                  the gsma mobile IoT refers specifically to cellular low-power
                  wide-area technologies using licensed spectrum bands. Both
                  3GPP Narrowband IoT and Long-Term Evolution Machine-Type
                  Communications technologies are integral to the new 5G era of
                  smart communications. Cellular LPWA paves the path to 5G with
                  undisrupted information flow. These 4G technologies are
                  expected to continue under full support in 5G networks for
                  many years and releases to come.3GPP technologies like 4G LTE
                  and 5G help businesses expand the reach of their IT and OT
                  networks across hard-to-reach areas and require both an easily
                  scalable deployment strategy and architecture.Think of smart
                  energy solutions in factory warehouses, where floor managers
                  must remotely regulate power usage and environmental
                  conditions for facilities and equipment across multiple sites
                  for thousands of connected devices. IoT makes this possible
                  with ease.Existing cellular networks are adapting to the
                  growing need to service the many billions of new devices
                  requiring connectivity solutions that make the grade primarily
                  in business dimensions and technically.Enterprises deploying
                  either NB-IoT or LTE-M are future-proofing their IoT projects.
                  When 5G rollouts become commonplace, these two mobile IoT
                  standards will continue integrating seamlessly into upcoming
                  5G releases. With 5G IoT, facilities will continue improving
                  to send critical upgrades to entire networks without freezing
                  functionality, halting operations or overloading servers.

                <h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Attacks</h3>

                <p>
                  Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, which are
                  considered immutable. However, the rise in popularity of
                  cryptocurrencies has encouraged cybercriminals to find
                  innovative ways to attack the underlying blockchain. One of
                  these ways is 51% attack”, which has evolved in recent years
                  and has been quite successful. Numerous 51% attacks have taken
                  place in recent years. In August 2021, Bitcoin SV (BSV) slid
                  about 5 per cent value after an attack. Another Bitcoin fork,
                  Bitcoin Gold (BTG), suffered a 51% attack in 2019. Ethereum
                  Classic (ETC), which forked from the original Ethereum
                  blockchain after the infamous DAO hack of 2016, has seen 51%
                  attacks several times. A hack in cryptocurrency can be many
                  things. In simple words, if an attacker is able to exploit
                  some area of a chain, smart contract, exchange or
                  illegitimately withdraw cryptocurrency, it would be deemed as
                  a hack or stealing. cryptocurrencies are encrypted using
                  blockchain technology, which is a public ledger that helps
                  verify and record transactions. Blockchain is constantly
                  reviewed by a network of users, which makes it difficult to
                  hack.When it comes to blockchains that use proof of work , 51%
                  of attacks involve the attacker being able to gain control of
                  more than 50 per cent of the hashing power. By doing so, he or
                  she is able to manipulate the data in the blockchain,. it’s
                  almost impossible to pull that off in established blockchains
                  like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This phenomenon has been
                  experienced by some small chains that are not really
                  decentralised, he added.attacks help hackers use one digital
                  token more than once by duplicating the file. 51% attack
                  enables them to rewrite transaction history and carry out
                  double spends. In a double spend, transactions are erased once
                  the goods are received. This means that the tokens can be used
                  again. Each crypto account is locked down by unbreakable
                  cryptography and a private key — a string of letters and
                  numbers — that serves as an identification code for each
                  crypto account holder. But hackers have shown that blockchains
                  are not immutable.poorly coded smart contract can be hacked by
                  someone sending certain instructions to it. In short, the
                  smart contract itself can be hacked, but not the blockchain.If
                  hackers get access to a wallet, they will be able to crack the
                  private key to the account, which is another way of crypto
                  hacking.the data in the blockchain is immutable. Even in these
                  hacks, the blockchain is mostly not compromised, he added.Many
                  countries have deemed crypto hacking illegal. The most common
                  types of crypto hacking are phishing and social engineering
                  attacks. However, when it comes to 51% attacks, there are not
                  many laws that prevent miners from taking control of more than
                  50 per cent of a network’s computing power.Though rare, more
                  devastating attacks happen where smart contracts get hacked or
                  exploited, giving the hacker access to large parts of a crypto
                  company's accounts and systems, said Huobi Global. “They are
                  able to steal crypto tokens worth millions at one go,” he
                  added.However, hackings can be goodwill gestures, too. For
                  example, when a hacker does it to point out a security
                  vulnerability in a smart contract so that a spiteful person
                  does not hack and steal the funds, causing losses to everyone.

                <h3>Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks</h3>

                <p className="text-justify">
                  Internet of Things is a catchall phrase for all the various
                  internet-connected devices that are not traditional computers.
                  This includes everything from fitness trackers and smart
                  watches to smart refrigerators, headphones, cameras, washing
                  machines, cars, traffic lights, airplane engines, and home
                  security systems.As access to broadband Internet service grows
                  and processors become more affordable, more and more gadgets
                  with Wi-Fi capabilities are being created. Today there are
                  billions of IoT devices in existence.this network of devices
                  produces great benefits and convenience for users, but IoT
                  devices can also be targeted by attackers as well as used to
                  carry out cyber attacks. As with internet-connected computers,
                  these devices are perfectly safe to use, but precautions
                  should be taken to ensure they aren’t compromised.‘Internet of
                  Things’ in, but developers have been playing with the idea of
                  internet-connected devices since the early. In fact, the first
                  IoT device was a modified soda machine made in that
                  transmitted data about its inventory and the temperature of
                  the drinks inside. This was a one-off prototype, and the
                  widespread proliferation of IoT devices didn’t start for
                  another 25 years. Two technologies helped pave the way for the
                  mass manufacture of IoT devices: RFID tags and IPv6 IP
                  addresses. RFID tags are small, lightweight electronic sensors
                  that can transmit information without a power source, and they
                  can be produced at very low cost. These tags can be as small
                  as a grain of rice, and their use has been widely adopted in
                  the industrial sector. RFID tags used in conjunction with IoT
                  devices have been used to track inventory in a warehouse,
                  parts on an assembly line, and even patients in a hospital.
                  This practice has saved countless hours of labor. The
                  industrial sector was also the first to use IoT-based security
                  systems, incorporating devices like smart cameras and smart
                  locks.the introduction of IPv6 addresses meant that the
                  dwindling number of IP addresses for internet devices was a
                  problem of the past, and helped open the floodgates for the
                  mass production of consumer IoT devices. The ‘smart home’
                  concept has also been a major driving factor in bringing IoT
                  devices to the hands of consumers, creating a heavy demand for
                  things like smart home security systems, cameras, televisions,
                  speakers (e.g. Google Home), lighting, and thermostats. the
                  first one is the devices themselves. Devices with either a
                  flawed or outdated design can present rich targets for
                  attackers. In the past, device security was often an
                  afterthought, so proper security didn’t get designed into the
                  product. Newer devices with a proper security design can still
                  have security bugs in their firmware, which requires that they
                  be updated whenever these bugs are found. Applications and
                  software present the third vector for IoT attacks.

                <h3>Phishing Scams</h3>

                <p className="text-justify">
                  Phishing is a type of online scam that targets consumers by
                  sending them an e-mail that appears to be from a well-known
                  source – an internet service provider, a bank, or a mortgage
                  company, for example. It asks the consumer to provide personal
                  identifying information. Then a scammer uses the information
                  to open new accounts, or invade the consumer’s existing
                  accounts. tech support scammers want you to believe you have a
                  serious problem with your computer, like a virus. They want
                  you to pay for tech support services you don't need, to fix a
                  problem that doesn’t exist. They often ask you to pay by
                  wiring money, putting money on a gift card, prepaid card or
                  cash reload card, or using a money transfer app because they
                  know those types of payments can be hard to reverse. Tech
                  support scammers may try to lure you with a pop-up window that
                  appears on your computer screen. It might look like an error
                  message from your operating system or antivirus software, and
                  it might use logos from trusted companies or websites. the
                  message in the window warns of a security issue on your
                  computer and tells you to call a phone number to get help.
                  Scammers use email or text messages to trick you into giving
                  them your personal information. But there are several things
                  you can do to protect yourself. Scammers use email or text
                  messages to trick you into giving them your personal
                  information. They may try to steal your passwords, account
                  numbers, or Social Security numbers. If they get that
                  information, they could gain access to your email, bank, or
                  other accounts. Scammers launch thousands of phishing attacks
                  like these every day — and they’re often successful. Scammers
                  often update their tactics, but there are some signs that will
                  help you recognize a phishing email or text message. Phishing
                  emails and text messages may look like they’re from a company
                  you know or trust. They may look like they’re from a bank, a
                  credit card company, a social networking site, an online
                  payment website or app, or an online store. The email looks
                  like it’s from a company you may know and trust: Netflix. It
                  even uses a Netflix logo and header. protect your mobile phone
                  by setting software to update automatically. These updates
                  could give you critical protection against security threats.
                  the email says your account is on hold because of a billing
                  problem. The email has a generic greeting, “Hi Dear.” If you
                  have an account with the business, it probably wouldn’t use a
                  generic greeting like this. The email invites you to click on
                  a link to update your payment details. While, at a glance,
                  this email might look real, it’s not. The scammers who send
                  emails like this one do not have anything to do with the
                  companies they pretend to be. Phishing emails can have real
                  consequences for people who give scammers their information.
                  And they can harm the reputation of the companies they’re
                  spoofing. Your email spam filters may keep many phishing
                  emails out of your inbox. But scammers are always trying to
                  outsmart spam filters, so it’s a good idea to add extra layers
                  of protection. Multi-factor authentication makes it harder for
                  scammers to log in to your accounts if they do get your
                  username and password.
