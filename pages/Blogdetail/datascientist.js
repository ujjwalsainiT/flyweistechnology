                <h3>Problem solving intuition</h3>
                <p>
                  If problems weren’t problematic enough, it seems there is a
                  prerequisite to solving them that many of us are unaware of.
                  The first step of problem-solving should be to determine
                  whether an intuitive or methodical approach is more
                  appropriate.Intuitive problem solving is based on intuition,
                  which is generally the brain’s ability to deduce conclusions
                  based on emotions and learned experiences. Because there is no
                  external influence while the process occurs within the mind,
                  the route to the conclusion is a one-way street. There is no
                  exact procedure, either, as no two people think exactly
                  alike.The advantage of intuitive thinking is that it is
                  lightning fast. Intuitive thinkers are also usually in tune
                  with the feelings of others, which increases the likelihood of
                  a widely acceptable result. Ironically, intuitive
                  problem-solving falters when it comes to group discussions –
                  the individual’s mental process can seem haphazard to everyone
                  else and instigate conflict.Methodical problem solving, also
                  known as rational problem solving, is as orderly as it sounds.
                  The process involves a step-by-step consideration of facts and
                  evidence and the logical conclusions to which they lead. It
                  is, or should be, the same regardless of whether employed by
                  an individual or group of people.That inherent consistency is
                  the methodical approach’s biggest strength. It allows a large
                  group of people to follow reason and arrive at the same
                  conclusion to complex problems. On the other hand, it can seem
                  unnecessarily long-winded to an individual and is rarely the
                  first option when assessing an issue on one’s own.It may seem
                  that the logical – and perhaps only – approach is to use
                  intuitive problem solving as an individual and the methodical
                  alternative at a group discussion. Generally, that is a safe
                  assumption but the astute leader knows that it is better to
                  pick the best of each world for the best results.Certainly,
                  follow the methodical approach when explaining your
                  conclusions at each step of the process. However, also
                  remember that people are complex creatures – what is “logical”
                  is not necessarily the most favored option.An example would be
                  a $1,000 smartphone. If phone manufacturers created their
                  products based simply on reason, they would be far less
                  costly. However, marketing executives apply their emotional
                  understanding to a pricing discussion. They conclude that the
                  price exclusivity factor appeals at an emotional level to
                  their target demographic and will perhaps improve rather than
                  discourage sales.As an individual, don’t completely forsake
                  methodical reasoning, either. While your instincts may be
                  right on the mark, use step-by-step logical reasoning to
                  buttress your opinion. In the workplace, it is a helpful way
                  to build consensus and demonstrate to others that your natural
                  talents are aligned with proven methods.

                <h3>Statistical knowledge</h3>
                <p>
                  Statistical knowledge for teaching is not precisely equivalent
                  to statistics subject matter knowledge. Teachers must know how
                  to make statistics understandable to others as well as
                  understand the subject matter themselves. This dual demand on
                  teachers calls for the development of viable teacher education
                  models. This paper offers one such model, which relies upon
                  engaging teachers in design-based research. Teachers
                  collaborate with a researcher to design, implement, and
                  analyze instruction to pursue desired statistical learning
                  outcomes for students. The researcher allows teachers enough
                  autonomy to make and learn from mistakes during the process.
                  Unpacking and addressing the mistakes has value as a means of
                  teacher learning. The model and a specific instance of its
                  implementation are described along with reflections on how
                  productive mistakes during design-based research provide
                  opportunities for fostering the development of statistical
                  knowledge for teaching. A great deal of statistics education
                  research is about understanding how students learn statistics
                  (Garfield, 1995; Garfield & Ben-Zvi, 2007; Shaughnessy, 2007).
                  A growing amount of statistics education research explores how
                  teachers learn statistics (e.g., Makar & Confrey, 2004;
                  Reading & Canada, 2011). Although research on how teachers
                  learn statistics is important, an additional core issue needs
                  attention: Along with learning statistics for themselves,
                  teachers must learn how to help others understand it. In order
                  to do so, teachers need to develop professional knowledge
                  beyond statistical subject matter knowledge. For example, they
                  must learn to assess and understand students’ reasoning
                  (Pfannkuch & Ben-Zvi, 2011), and select tasks suitable for
                  advancing students’ learning. Learning the subject matter of
                  statistics is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for
                  teaching it. Shulman (1987) coined the phrase pedagogical
                  content knowledge to describe the knowledge teachers need in
                  order to make subject matter comprehensible to students. He
                  called it a “special amalgam of content and pedagogy that is
                  uniquely the province of teachers” (p. 8). Researchers in
                  mathematics and statistics education have appropriated,
                  refined, and extended Shulman’s notion of pedagogical content
                  knowledge to describe the professional knowledge teachers
                  need. One such notable effort was that of the Learning
                  Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project (Ball, Thames, &
                  Phelps, 2008). The LMT model conceptualized mathematical
                  knowledge for teaching as consisting of both subject matter
                  knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, and made
                  hypotheses about the nature of each of these knowledge
                  domains. In the LMT model, subject matter knowledge and
                  pedagogical content knowledge are multi-faceted. Subject
                  matter knowledge consists of common knowledge, specialized
                  knowledge, and horizon knowledge. Common knowledge is that
                  which is required across a variety of occupations, and is not
                  unique to teaching (e.g., calculating statistics,
                  understanding their meanings, etc.). Specialized knowledge is
                  unique to the task of teaching. It allows teachers to appraise
                  students’ non-conventional representations and approaches to
                  problems. Horizon knowledge entails knowing subject matter
                  beyond the school curriculum and allows teachers to steer
                  students’ learning appropriately as opportunities arise (Ball
                  et al., 2008). Statistical knowledge for teaching is not
                  precisely equivalent to statistics subject matter knowledge.
                  Teachers must know how to make statistics understandable to
                  others as well as understand the subject matter themselves.
                  This dual demand on teachers calls for the development of
                  viable teacher education models. This paper offers one such
                  model, which relies upon engaging teachers in design-based

                  subject matter comprehensible to students. He called it a

                <h3>Programming in an analytic language (R or Python)</h3>
                <p>
                  If you work in data science or analytics, you’re probably well
                  aware of the Python vs. R debate. Although both languages are
                  bringing the future to life — through artificial intelligence,
                  machine learning and data-driven innovation — there are
                  strengths and weaknesses that come into play. In many ways,
                  the two open source languages are very similar. Free to
                  download for everyone, both languages are well suited for data
                  science tasks — from data manipulation and automation to
                  business analysis and big data exploration. The main
                  difference is that Python is a general-purpose programming
                  language, while R has its roots in statistical
                  analysis. Increasingly, the question isn’t which to choose,
                  but how to make the best use of both programming languages for
                  your specific use cases. Python is a general-purpose,
                  object-oriented programming language that emphasizes code
                  readability through its generous use of white space. Released
                  in 1989, Python is easy to learn and a favorite of programmers
                  and developers. In fact, Python is one of the most popular
                  programming languages in the world, just behind Java and C.
                  Plus, Python is particularly well suited for deploying machine
                  learning at a large scale. Its suite of specialized deep
                  learning and machine learning libraries includes tools like
                  scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow, which enable data
                  scientists to develop sophisticated data models that plug
                  directly into a production system. Then, Jupyter Notebooks are
                  an open source web application for easily sharing documents
                  that contain your live Python code, equations, visualizations
                  and data science explanations. R is an open source programming
                  language that’s optimized for statistical analysis and data
                  visualization. Developed in 1992, R has a rich ecosystem with
                  complex data models and elegant tools for data reporting. At
                  last count, more than 13,000 R packages were available via the
                  Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) for deep analytics.
                  Popular among data science scholars and researchers, R
                  provides a broad variety of libraries and tools for the
                  following: R is commonly used within RStudio, an integrated
                  development environment (IDE) for simplified statistical
                  analysis, visualization and reporting. R applications can be
                  used directly and interactively on the web via Shiny. The main
                  distinction between the two languages is in their approach to
                  data science. Both open source programming languages are
                  supported by large communities, continuously extending their
                  libraries and tools. But while R is mainly used for
                  statistical analysis, Python provides a more general approach
                  to data wrangling. Python is a multi-purpose language, much
                  like C++ and Java, with a readable syntax that’s easy to
                  learn. Programmers use Python to delve into data analysis or
                  use machine learning in scalable production environments. For
                  example, you might use Python to build face recognition into
                  your mobile API or for developing a machine learning
                  application. R, on the other hand, is built by statisticians
                  and leans heavily into statistical models and specialized
                  analytics. Data scientists use R for deep statistical
                  analysis, supported by just a few lines of code and beautiful
                  data visualizations. For example, you might use R for customer
                  behavior analysis or genomics research.

                <h3>Curiosity (keep asking why)</h3>
                <p>
                  We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new
                  things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us
                  down new paths. While college teaches you a lot, I think what
                  it might do best is drive a curiosity within you and a desire
                  to learn more.Yes, you can go to class every day. You can
                  listen to the lectures and discussions and pick up on the
                  material. You can take the tests, get good grades, yada yada
                  yada. Of course, this is all important; a good GPA will help
                  you earn jobs and other opportunities down the road. But if
                  you really want to strive to make the most of college
                  curriculum, I think being curious is the best way to do
                  so.Learning something only to learn it for the test and then
                  forget it seems a little pointless, right? After all, you
                  should learn to understand something, whether it be a
                  conceptual idea or technical skill. And if you truly want to
                  flesh out your ability to learn something, being curious and
                  asking “why” is probably your best bet.I am an operations and
                  information management major (OIM), and when I tell that to
                  people, it mostly just flies over their heads. In my
                  coursework, I’ve been learning a bit about database
                  structures, analytics, and the “internet of things.” If you
                  told me three years ago this is what I’d be doing in college,
                  I probably wouldn’t have believed you. I twice changed my
                  major before settling on OIM, but ever since I started
                  learning about the topic, my interest in the field has only
                  grown. There’s already so much data out there (over sixteen
                  trillion gigabytes, to be exact) and this number grows every
                  day. I think what pushes my curiosity in the topic is the
                  desire to have a part in handling it all, an important task
                  that will keep society functioning on a day-to-day basis, help
                  effectively communicate and influence decision making in both
                  a resource-friendly and ecologically-efficient manner.One of
                  my favorite summer reading books growing up was Rocket Boys by
                  Homer Hickam, based on a true story of a group of boys with a
                  rocketry fascination in a small mining town in 1957 West
                  Virginia. Against all odds, the boys worked on building and
                  launching model rockets, eventually working their way out of
                  the cycle of life in the town in which most young boys grow up
                  to be coal miners. Driven by their curiosity, the boys were
                  able to reach a previously unfathomable goal. Taking this
                  lesson and applying it today, it can inspire us to keep a
                  curious mind.I think the Rocket Boys set a good standard to
                  look up to; it’s never a bad thing to be curious, and often
                  our curiosity pushes us to otherwise unreachable places.
                  Behind everything we learn and everything we observe, there
                  may be some context that we are missing, and understanding the
                  context of these situations can only be achieved if we ask
                  “why?” I’ve found this method of analyzing situations and
                  asking the “why” question to be important in both my work here
                  at the Honors College and as a reporter for the Daily
                  Collegian newspaper, where asking why something is the way it
                  is challenges an interviewee to reflect and give a more
                  well-thought-out answer than just asking surface questions.
                  However, not just asking others, but also asking
                  yourself why you see something the way you do is a helpful
                  self-reflection tool.
