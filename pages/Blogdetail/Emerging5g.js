                <h3>Emerging 5G Application</h3>

                <p>
                  5G is not just an evolutionary upgrade of the previous
                  generation of cellular, but it is a revolutionary technology
                  envisioned that will eliminate the bounds of access,
                  bandwidth, performance, and latency limitations on
                  connectivity worldwide. 5G has the potential to enable
                  fundamentally new applications, industries, and business
                  models and dramatically improve quality of life around the
                  world via unprecedented use cases that require high data-rate
                  instantaneous communications, low latency, and massive
                  connectivity for new applications for mobile, eHealth,
                  autonomous vehicles, smart cities, smart homes, and the IoT.
                  5G is about a new communication system that includes a mostly
                  framework and an entirely new core network that aims to
                  improve wireless connections worldwide. It also includes the
                  concept of multiple access for connectivity technologies like
                  satellites, wi-fi fixed-line and cellular/ With IoT-enabled
                  devices in mind, 5G connects more devices at higher speeds and
                  makes things like lag nearly non-existent. As a result, 5G
                  creates an excellent user experience irrespective of what
                  application, device or service you touch. technologies are
                  characterized as a low-cost, low-power consumption solution.
                  They thrive on deep and broad coverage indoors and outdoors.
                  They deliver secure connectivity and authentication, are easy
                  to deploy to any network topology and are designed for full
                  scope scalability and capacity upgrades.Businesses, city
                  developers and other industrial organizations can connect more
                  devices with better capability for much less — all with the
                  power of 5G adaptability at their fingertips. As proposed by
                  the gsma mobile IoT refers specifically to cellular low-power
                  wide-area technologies using licensed spectrum bands. Both
                  3GPP Narrowband IoT and Long-Term Evolution Machine-Type
                  Communications technologies are integral to the new 5G era of
                  smart communications. Cellular LPWA paves the path to 5G with
                  undisrupted information flow. These 4G technologies are
                  expected to continue under full support in 5G networks for
                  many years and releases to come.3GPP technologies like 4G LTE
                  and 5G help businesses expand the reach of their IT and OT
                  networks across hard-to-reach areas and require both an easily
                  scalable deployment strategy and architecture.Think of smart
                  energy solutions in factory warehouses, where floor managers
                  must remotely regulate power usage and environmental
                  conditions for facilities and equipment across multiple sites
                  for thousands of connected devices. IoT makes this possible
                  with ease.Existing cellular networks are adapting to the
                  growing need to service the many billions of new devices
                  requiring connectivity solutions that make the grade primarily
                  in business dimensions and technically.Enterprises deploying
                  either NB-IoT or LTE-M are future-proofing their IoT projects.
                  When 5G rollouts become commonplace, these two mobile IoT
                  standards will continue integrating seamlessly into upcoming
                  5G releases. With 5G IoT, facilities will continue improving
                  to send critical upgrades to entire networks without freezing
                  functionality, halting operations or overloading servers.
